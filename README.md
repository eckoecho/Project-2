# Project-2

**Data Dictionary:**
| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **AQI** | Air Quality Environment |
| **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**| CO is a colorless, odorless gas that is produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels. High levels of CO can be toxic to humans and can cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea
| **Ozone** | Ozone is a gas that can form in the atmosphere through a chemical reaction between sunlight and other pollutants. High levels of ozone can be harmful to human health, particularly for those with respiratory issues.|
| **NO2** | Nitrogen Dioxide, which is a reddish-brown gas and one of the main pollutants in the atmosphere. It is primarily emitted from combustion processes, such as vehicle engines, power plants, and industrial activities. |
| **PM2.5** | PM2.5 refers to tiny particles or droplets in the air that are 2.5 micrometers or less in width. They can be harmful to human health when inhaled, especially in high concentrations.|
